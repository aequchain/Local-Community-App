**4. Modular Pod Architecture**

**Concept:**

Instead of single monolithic generators, larger systems built from standardized 5kW modules (pods) that connect together electrically and mechanically.

**Benefits:**

**Scalability:**
- Start with 1 pod (5kW) and add more as needs grow
- Maximum recommended: 10 pods (50kW) without additional infrastructure
- Beyond 50kW: Separate systems with load balancing controller

**Redundancy:**
- If one pod fails, others continue operating
- System degrades gracefully rather than complete failure
- Critical loads prioritized automatically

**Serviceability:**
- Individual pods can be removed for service without shutting down entire system
- Swap-out replacement: Defective pod removed, replacement installed in <1 hour
- Reduces downtime to near-zero

**Economic:**

- Spread cost over time as budget allows
- DIY-friendly: Build one pod at a time

**Pod Design:**

**Physical:**
- Dimensions: 550mm × 380mm × 280mm (same as SHA-5K)
- Weight: 22 kg

- Active balancing: Communication bus coordinates to ensure equal power from all pods

**Fault Management:**
- Continuous health monitoring: Each pod reports status

- 3 pods: 150A or 300A
- Use case: High-current loads, rapid battery charging

**Mixed Configuration:**
- 2 series strings of 2 parallel pods = 96V/100A or 800V/6A
- Flexibility: Can reconfigure via software without rewiring

**Master-Slave Architecture:**
- One pod designated as master (has external communication, display)

- Transparent to user: System appears as single generator
- Automatic failover: If master fails, another pod becomes master

**5. Secondary Winding Regeneration System**

**Principle:**

In addition to primary windings that generate main power, secondary windings capture "leftover" magnetic flux that would otherwise be wasted.

**Configuration:**

**Primary Windings:**
- Purpose: Main power generation (AC output, rectified to DC)
- Position: Aligned with rotor magnets at optimal angle
- Power: 85-90% of mechanical input converted to electrical output

**Secondary/Auxiliary Windings:**
- Purpose: Capture residual flux, battery charging
- Position: Offset 10-15° from primary (spatially or temporally)
- Power: 10-15% additional capture of mechanical input
- Total system efficiency: 95-98% (sum of primary + secondary)

**Physics:**

When primary windings are at peak flux linkage, secondary windings are slightly offset and capture flux from the "edges" of the magnetic field or from slight timing differences.

**No Interference Principle:**
- Secondary windings positioned so they don't oppose primary field
- Different circuit: Independently controlled, separate rectification
- Flux "steering": Halbach array directs most flux to primary, residual to secondary
- Mutual inductance minimized: Careful winding arrangement prevents coupling

**Output Characteristics:**

**Primary Output:**
- Voltage: 200-450V AC (3-phase), rectified to 400V DC (or stepped down)
- Current: Varies with load, up to rated capacity

**Secondary Output:**
- Voltage: 12-48V DC (direct from rectification, optimized for battery charging)
- Current: 5-50A depending on variant
- Use: Direct battery charging, low-voltage loads, auxiliary power

**Advantages:**

- 3-5% efficiency improvement over single-winding design
- Reduces wasted magnetic flux

**Battery Charging:**

**Redundancy:**
- If primary circuit fails, secondary can provide limited power (10-15% of rated)
- Emergency operation mode: Secondary becomes primary

4. AI system analyzes conditions (RPM, temperature, load)
5. Windings energize (primary for generation, auxiliary for charging)
6. Output stabilizes (voltage regulation, power quality control)
7. System enters normal operating mode

**Manual Start:**
1. Inspect system (visual check, no damage or obstruction)
2. Enable system (power switch or app control)

3. Structural resonance (mounting frequency matches rotor frequency)
4. Loose components (bolts, covers)

**Diagnosis:**
- Vibration frequency analysis (compare to RPM, identify harmonics)
- Inspect rotor (visual, spin by hand)
- Check bearings (maglev sensor readings, touchdown bearing condition)
- Inspect structure (tighten all fasteners)

**Solution:**
- Balance rotor (add/remove weight, precision balancing)
- Replace bearings (touchdown bearings if worn)
- Modify mounting (change stiffness, add damping)
- Tighten all fasteners

**3. Standardized Interfaces:**
- Mechanical coupling: Universal joint interface (household generator shaft ↔ vehicle motor shaft)
- Electrical connection: Standardized voltage levels (48V, 400V, 800V)
- Communication: CAN bus, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth (same protocols)
- Physical connectors: Same plug types (vehicle charging ↔ household output)

**Integration Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)**

**Concept:** Electric vehicle battery powers home during outages or peak demand periods.

**Implementation:**
1. EV parked at home, connected to household system
2. Bidirectional inverter/charger manages energy flow
3. When grid fails or electricity prices are high:
   - Vehicle battery discharges
   - Powers household loads
   - Household generator (if producing) charges vehicle
4. When grid restores or prices drop:
   - Vehicle recharges from grid or household generator
   - System returns to normal

**Technical Requirements:**
- Bidirectional charger: Capable of both charging (grid/generator → vehicle) and discharging (vehicle → home)
- Power rating: 7-11 kW (typical Level 2 charger, adequate for most home loads)
- Communication: Vehicle CAN bus ↔ home energy management system
- Safety: Anti-islanding protection, proper grounding, overcurrent protection

**Benefits:**
- Backup power: Vehicle provides 40-100 kWh of stored energy (power home for 1-5 days)
- Peak shaving: Reduce grid consumption during expensive periods
- Energy independence: Vehicle + household generator = complete autonomy

**Scenario 2: Home-to-Vehicle (H2V) Charging**

**Concept:** Household generator charges electric vehicle.

**Implementation:**
1. Vehicle plugged into household generator output
2. Generator produces power (wind, hydro, manual, solar-thermal)
3. Power flows to vehicle battery (via onboard charger or external charger)
4. Charging continues until battery full or input ceases

**Charging Rates:**
- Level 1 (120V, 12-16A): 1.4-1.9 kW (10-15 hours for 40 kWh battery)
- Level 2 (240V, 16-40A): 3.8-9.6 kW (4-10 hours)
- DC Fast Charge
