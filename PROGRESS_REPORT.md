## 🎉 Recent Achievements

### Per-Capita Insights Refinement
- **Enhanced math precision**: Changed from whole units to 2 decimal places for accurate small amounts
- **Improved formatting**: Implemented RichText with bold emphasis
  - Format: `"$X.XX from each Region Name"`
  - Bold: amount and location name
- **Visual consistency**: Bar icon (`Icons.equalizer_rounded`) across card and detail views
- **Color coding**: Secondary (community), Tertiary (region), Primary (nation)
- **Smart ordering**: Region → City → Country (most relevant first)

### Filter & Search Implementation ✨ NEW
- **Filter Sheet**
  - Campaign type selection (Business, Community, Social, Infrastructure, Education, Healthcare, Agriculture, Technology)
  - Location text search (city/region/country)
  - Clear all / Apply filters actions
  - Active filter indicator (colored icon in AppBar)
- **Search Delegate**
  - Full-text search across title, description, and location
  - List view results with campaign cards
  - Tap to navigate to detail
  - Clear button for query reset
- **Empty states**: Contextual messaging for no results vs. no campaigns

## 🚀 Next Development Priorities

### Phase 1: User Experience Enhancement
1. **Create Campaign Flow** (HIGH)
   - Multi-step form (details → location → funding goal → review)
   - Image upload capability
   - Draft save functionality
   - Validation with helpful error messages

2. **Contribution Flow** (HIGH)
   - Payment integration prep (Stripe/PayPal placeholder)
   - Contribution history
   - Receipt generation
   - Success animation

3. **Profile Screen** (MEDIUM)
   - User info display/edit
   - My campaigns list
   - Contribution history
   - Settings (notifications, privacy)

### Phase 2: Backend Integration
1. **Firebase Setup** (HIGH)
   - Authentication (Email/Password, Google Sign-In)
   - Firestore schema design
   - Storage for campaign images
   - Security rules

2. **Repository Implementation** (HIGH)
   - Replace mock repos with Firebase
   - Offline persistence (Riverpod + Hive)
   - Real-time updates (StreamProvider)
   - Pagination for large datasets

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Social Features** (MEDIUM)
   - Campaign comments
   - Updates from creators
   - Share functionality
   - Follow campaigns

2. **Analytics** (MEDIUM)
   - Campaign performance metrics
   - User engagement tracking
   - A/B testing infrastructure
   - Error monitoring (Sentry)

3. **Gamification** (LOW)
   - Badges for contributions
   - Leaderboards
   - Achievement system
   - Referral program

## 🎯 Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add integration tests for filter/search flows
- [ ] Implement error boundaries for async failures
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- [ ] Optimize image loading with caching (cached_network_image)
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for interactive elements
- [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh analytics

### Documentation Needed
- [ ] API documentation (once backend is live)
- [ ] User guide for campaign creators
- [ ] Developer onboarding guide
- [ ] Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

---

## 📈 Metrics & Performance

### Build Stats
- **Analyzer**: 0 issues
- **Test Coverage**: ~60% (widget tests only)
- **Build Time**: ~2s (debug)
- **App Size**: TBD (production build pending)

### Code Quality
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Low (avg. 3-5)
- **Coupling**: Minimal (feature-first structure)
- **Test Pyramid**: Unit (80%) → Widget (15%) → Integration (5%) target

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Notes

### For Backend Team
- Mock repositories in `lib/src/features/*/data/` show expected API contracts
- Campaign model includes all fields for Firestore schema
- Authentication flow ready for Firebase Auth drop-in replacement

### For Design Team
- All hardcoded colors should migrate to theme extensions
- Spacing uses Fibonacci tokens; request new values if needed
- Hero image aspect ratio: 1.618 (golden ratio)

### For QA Team
- Run `flutter test` for automated widget tests
- Manual test: Filter by "Agriculture" + location "CA" should show matching campaigns
- Accessibility: Screen reader should announce per-capita amounts correctly

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Per-Capita Display
**Why bar icons?** Visual consistency, better than chip-style pills at small sizes  
**Why 2 decimals?** Accurately shows micro-contributions (e.g., $0.12 per person)  
**Why bold formatting?** Increases scannability, draws eye to key numbers

### Filter Before Search
**Rationale:** Users typically narrow by type/location before free-text search  
**UX Flow:** Filter icon shows active state, search opens full-screen delegate

### Grid Over List
**Benefit:** More visual appeal, better use of wide screens (tablet/desktop)  
**Trade-off:** Requires more scroll on mobile, but acceptable for discovery
