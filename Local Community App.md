## 💰 Revenue Model (Sustainability)

### 6.1 Primary Revenue Streams

```
1. Platform Fee (Main Revenue)
   - 3-5% fee on successfully funded campaigns
   - Transparent, displayed upfront
   - Only charged when goal is reached (no upfront cost)
   - Example: $10,000 campaign = $300-$500 platform fee

2. Withdrawal Fees
   - $0.50 or 1% (whichever is higher) for bank withdrawals
   - Covers payment processing costs

3. Premium Features (Optional)
   - Campaign creators can purchase:
     * Featured placement on home page ($50-$200)
     * Extended campaign duration ($25)
     * Advanced analytics ($10/month)
   - Job posters:
     * Premium job listings (top of search results) ($20-$50 per listing)
     * Bulk job posting packages ($100 for 10 jobs)

4. Marketplace Commissions (Phase 2+)
   - 2-3% on accommodation bookings
   - 1-2% on classifieds transactions (if facilitated)
   - Subscription for business directory premium listings ($15/month)

5. B2B Partnerships
   - White-label licensing for other regions/countries ($5,000-$50,000/year)
   - Corporate sponsorships of campaigns (matching funds)
   - Government contracts for employment services

6. Advertising (Minimal, Non-Intrusive)
   - Sponsored campaigns (clearly labeled)
   - Local business ads in relevant categories
   - Strict policy: No ads on charity/social campaigns
```

### 6.2 Cost Structure Projection

```
Fixed Costs (Monthly):
- Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Firebase): $500-$2,000 (scales with users)
- Payment processing infrastructure: $200
- Third-party APIs (Maps, Search, SMS): $300-$1,000
- Customer support staff: $2,000-$5,000
- Legal & compliance: $500
- Marketing: $1,000-$10,000

Variable Costs:
- Payment processing fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (Stripe)
- Customer acquisition cost: $2-$10 per user (ad spend)

Break-Even Analysis:
- At 3% platform fee, need $100,000 in monthly GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)
  to cover $3,000 base costs
- Achievable with 100 campaigns x $1,000 average goal, or 20 campaigns x $5,000
- Realistic target: 6-12 months to break-even in pilot city
