# Local Community App

Mobilizing Communities for Economic Development
================================================

A mobile-first, cross-platform open-source application that democratizes access to funding and employment opportunities within local communities worldwide.


Vision
------

Transform economic empowerment globally through a Flutter-based platform connecting fundraising campaigns, job opportunities, marketplace services, and community impact analyticsâ€”starting with a single-city pilot, scaling to worldwide adoption.


Core Value Proposition
-----------------------

- **For the World:** A replicable, adaptable framework for any community, region, or nation

This project is 100% open-source and designed to remain community-owned. No single person or entity should financially benefit from the core platform: the recommended rollout is zero commissions and zero fees (0% commission, 0 fees) to prioritize fast, broad, and inclusive economic stimulation and mobilization.

- **Architect Agent:** System design & infrastructure  
- **Builder Agent:** Implementation (frontend & backend)
- **Security & Compliance Agent:** Authentication, payments, fraud prevention
- **Quality & Reliability Agent:** Testing, performance, monitoring
- **Documentation & Advocacy Agent:** Technical docs & community engagement

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed agent responsibilities and workflows.


Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to install Dart and Flutter. Firebase and Stripe are optional for demo purposes.

#### Installing Flutter (includes Dart)

1. Download the Flutter SDK from the official website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux

2. Extract the downloaded file to a desired location, e.g., `~/flutter`:

   ```bash
   tar xf ~/Downloads/flutter_linux_*.tar.xz -C ~/
   ```

3. Add Flutter to your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:~/flutter/bin"
   ```

4. Reload your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or equivalent).

5. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

This will install both Flutter and Dart, as Dart is bundled with Flutter.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aequchain/Local-Community-App.git
cd Local-Community-App/local_community_app

# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
# For any connected device (mobile/web/desktop)
flutter run

# For Chrome browser in release mode with WASM
flutter run -d chrome --release --wasm

# For Linux desktop
flutter run -d linux

# For Android mobile
flutter run --release # Connected Android device with USB debugging/debug mode ENABLED in you Android device Settings > Developer Options


# Other platform options:
# Android emulator: 
flutter run -d emulator
# iOS simulator (macOS only): 
flutter run -d simulator
# Specific device: flutter run -d <device_id> (use `flutter devices` to list available devices)
```

### Development Setup

See the [comprehensive development plan](Local%20Community%20App.md) for detailed architecture, database schemas, and implementation guidance.

### Current build snapshot (October 2025)
- âœ… Flutter 3.35 project scaffolded under `local_community_app/`
- âœ… Riverpod + GoRouter + Aequus design tokens wired into a responsive landing screen prototype
- âœ… Firebase CLI installed and authenticated (next step: `firebase init firestore functions hosting storage emulators` inside `local_community_app/` to generate config files)
- âœ… Free-tier friendly dependency set (Firebase Spark, Flutter web builds, no paid APIs wired yet)
- ðŸ”œ Implement authentication onboarding flow followed by campaign/job domain models backed by Firestore
