# Local Community App - Development Progress

## üé® Aequus Design System Implementation

This Flutter application implements the **Aequus Design Protocol** - a comprehensive design system based on mathematical harmony using Fibonacci spacing and prime-number animation durations.

### Design Tokens

#### Spacing (Fibonacci Sequence)
```dart
s3: 3px    s5: 5px    s8: 8px    s13: 13px
s21: 21px  s34: 34px  s55: 55px  s89: 89px
s144: 144px
```

#### Animation Durations (Prime Numbers)
```dart
p89: 89ms (fast)        // Instant feedback
p233: 233ms (moderate)  // Quick transitions
p377: 377ms (relaxed)   // Smooth animations
p610: 610ms (slow)      // Deliberate effects
```

#### Border Radii (Fibonacci)
```dart
s3, s5, s8, s13, s21, s34
```

#### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 610px (P4)
- **Tablet**: 610px - 987px (P5)
- **Desktop**: > 987px

#### Golden Ratio
- Image aspect ratios: 1.618:1
- Line height for body text: 1.618

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Clean Architecture Layers

```
lib/src/features/<feature>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/           # Business entities and repository interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/            # Repository implementations (mock/real)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/     # Use cases and Riverpod providers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/    # UI screens and widgets
```

### State Management
- **Riverpod 2.x** for dependency injection and state management
- Providers for:
  - `authStateChangesProvider` (Stream) - Authentication state
  - `activeCampaignsProvider` (Stream) - Real-time campaign updates
  - `fetchCampaignsProvider` (Future) - One-time campaign fetch
  - `campaignByIdProvider(id)` (Future) - Individual campaign details

### Mock Implementations
All repositories have mock implementations for development without Firebase:
- **MockAuthRepository**: Simulates sign-in with 233-610ms delays
- **MockCampaignRepository**: Provides 5 sample campaigns with realistic data
- Mock data includes campaigns from Nairobi, Accra, Lagos, Cape Town, Cairo

## üéØ Responsive Design

### Breakpoint Logic
```dart
final width = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
final crossAxisCount = width < 610 ? 1 : (width < 987 ? 2 : 3);
```

### Mobile (< 610px)
- Single column grid
- Full-width cards
- Compact spacing (F1-F8)

### Tablet (610-987px)
- Two-column grid
- Medium spacing (F8-F13)
- Touch-optimized buttons

### Desktop (> 987px)
- Three-column grid
- Generous spacing (F13-F21)
- Hover interactions

## üé≠ Animation Specifications

### Timing Functions
```dart
// Fast feedback (hover, button press)
AequusDesignTokens.durations.fast // 89ms (P2)

// Moderate transitions (page navigation)
AequusDesignTokens.durations.moderate // 233ms (P3)

// Relaxed animations (list items, cards)
AequusDesignTokens.durations.relaxed // 377ms (P5)

// Slow, deliberate effects (hero animations)
AequusDesignTokens.durations.slow // 610ms (P4)
```

### Staggered Animations
```dart
// Campaign feed cards
final delay = Duration(
  milliseconds: 233 + (index * 34), // P3 + (index √ó F7)
);
```

### Hover Interactions
```dart
// Campaign card hover
Transform.scale(
  scale: 1.0 + (controller.value * 0.02), // 2% scale increase
  child: Card(
    elevation: 2.0 + (controller.value * 6), // 2 ‚Üí 8 elevation
  ),
);
```

## üìê Design Principles

### 1. **Mathematical Harmony**
All spacing, timing, and proportions derive from Fibonacci sequence and prime numbers, creating a naturally balanced visual rhythm.

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
Information is revealed gradually (card ‚Üí detail ‚Üí contribution) to prevent overwhelming users.

### 3. **Responsive by Default**
Every component adapts to screen size using breakpoints at 610px and 987px.

### 4. **Accessibility**
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards

### 5. **Performance**
- Lazy loading for images
- Optimistic UI updates
- Efficient state management with Riverpod
- Mock data for fast development iteration

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Planned)
- Repository mock implementations
- Campaign model computed properties
- Form validation logic

### Widget Tests (Planned)
- Campaign card rendering
- Profile screen states
- Authentication flow

### Integration Tests (Planned)
- End-to-end sign-in ‚Üí browse ‚Üí contribute flow
- Navigation between screens
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

---

## üìù Code Conventions

### File Naming
- `snake_case` for file names
- `UpperCamelCase` for class names
- `lowerCamelCase` for variables/methods

### Architecture Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Separate data access from business logic
- **Provider Pattern**: Riverpod for dependency injection
- **BLoC-lite**: StateNotifiers for complex state (planned)

### Comments
- Use `//` for single-line explanations
- Document Aequus design token usage with `// Aequus: F13, P3` markers
- Add `TODO:` comments for future enhancements
